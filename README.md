Bubble-Sorting
First of all question is that what is bubble sort? Bubble sort is an aglorithm in which it compares two adjacent elements and swaps them if they are not in the intended order. if list with n elements then it requires n-1 passes for sorting. complexity in bubble sort for worst case is O(n^2) , for average case O(n^2) and for best case O(n).

WORKING OF BUBBLE SORT

STEPS ARE :-

Starting from the first index, compare the first and the sceond element .
if the first elements is greater than the second elements, they are Swapped.
Now, compare the second and the third elements . Swap them if they are not in order.
this goes on until the last element . the same process goes on for the remaining iterations. After each iteration , the largest element among the unsorted element is placed at the end.
